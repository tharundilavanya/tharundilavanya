### Hi <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"> I'm Thanuka Perera

🎓 I'm an undergraduate at the University of Moratuwa, following a BSc (Hons) in Information Technology.  
💻 I'm passionate about **web development**, **embedded systems**, and **IoT**, with a strong interest in **innovative problem-solving** and real-world applications.

I believe in building solutions that matter — from **wearable healthcare** to **parcel management systems**, and even **mocktail machines** powered by microcontrollers. I'm a former **rugby player with national university-level representation (SLUG 2023)**, now channeling that team spirit and discipline into tech.

- 🔭 Currently working on: Smart biomedical wearables & IoT prototypes  
- 💬 Ask me about: React, MongoDB, Embedded Projects, and System Design  
- 📫 Reach me at: thanukaperera.dev@gmail.com  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love hiking, gym, and building things from scratch!
